# Economics Of Wind Energy

## This is a simple project to calculate the economic viability of a wind farm project

Some design considerations:

  - The project was developed using OOP, in which we sought to apply knowledge of inheritance and polymorphism;
  - The mathematical equations used to develop the project are based on the course on wind energy at DTU university on the Coursera platform;
  - As an external library to Python's built-in libraries, the following were used: Pandas, tabulate and calculations.
